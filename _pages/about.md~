I'm Rien, an aspiring to be cognitive (neuro)scientist. 
I'm a motivated and curious person, with a passion for entrepeneurship, technology, and the inner workings of humans and animals. My main research interests are *Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI)*, *Cognitive Modeling*, and *Cognitive Enhancement*. 

I worked 6 months in Shanghai as a **Research intern at at New York University Shanghai (NYUSH)**; since the COVID-19 outbreak I'm working from my home in Belgium (Stay safe!). 

My education: 

- **Master of Science (M.S.)** Experimental and Theoretical Psychology, minor in Neuroscience<br/> 
at Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium)<br/>
Graduating in the summer of 2020.

- **Bachelor of Science (B.S.)** Experimental and Theoretical Psychology<br/>
at Ghent University (Ghent, Belgium)<br/>
Graduated with Honors.

**Searching for research opportunities!**
