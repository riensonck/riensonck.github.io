I'm Rien, a master's student and an apprentice (neuro)cognitive scientist. 
I have a passion for entrepeneurship, technology and doing research. 
I'm curious about the human brain and I am always ready to learn more. 
My main research interests include: 
*Brain-computer Interfaces (BCI)*, *Cognitive Modeling* and *Cognitive Enhancement*.
