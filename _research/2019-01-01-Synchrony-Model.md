**[Still in Progress]**, Implementing flexibility mechanically has been a key computational issue in the cognitive control literature. To achieve this, Verguts (2017) developed a model of cognitive control based on oscillatory mechanisms. This model employs “binding by random bursts”, a combination of two principles, namely, communication-through-coherence and noise-induced synchronization. The aim of this project is to test whether oscillatory mechanisms responsible for connecting relevant representations also induce oscillations in behavioral performance.
