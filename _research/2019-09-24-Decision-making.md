**[Still in Progress]**, The aim of this study is to investigate similarities and differences in decsion-making across species. For this we developed a risk-non-verbal task, adapted from Lukinova et al. (2019) delay non-verbal task and mirrors the training procedure used with rodents in the Erlich's lab.
